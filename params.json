See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n## Third-Party Licenses\r\n\r\nSee public/licenses.txt\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* Ruby 2.1.2\r\n* [Pow](http://pow.cx/) is recommended for local testing with Earthdata Login\r\n* A Ruby manager such as [RVM](http://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) is strongly recommended.\r\n* (For shapefile support) access to an [ogre](http://ogre.adc4gis.com) server\r\n* (For placename completion) a [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org) account\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you will need the following, which will be installed automatically by `bin/setup` on most UNIX-like systems:\r\n\r\n* Postgres development headers\r\n  * Mac (homebrew): `brew install postgresql`\r\n  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y libpq-dev`\r\n  * RHEL: `sudo yum install -y postgresql-devel`\r\n\r\n* Node.js (with npm)\r\n  * Mac (homebrew): `brew install node`\r\n  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`\r\n  * RHEL: `sudo curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup | bash - && sudo yum install -y nodejs`\r\n\r\n### Earthdata Login (URS) Configuration\r\n\r\nIf you would like to set up Earthdata Login login, you will need to perform the following steps:\r\n\r\nRegister an account on [the Earthdata Login home page](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home)\r\n\r\nCreate an application in the Earthdata Login console.  Its callback URL should be `http://<domain>/urs_callback`.  If you are using Pow, this will be something\r\nlike `http://earthdata-search.dev/urs_callback`\r\n\r\nClick the \"Feedback\" icon on the Earthdata Login page and request that your new application be placed in the ECHO application group\r\n(required for ECHO/CMR to recognize your tokens).\r\n\r\nModify line 37 of `config/services.yml` to contain your Earthdata Login application's client ID\r\n\r\n### Application configuration\r\n\r\nIf using Pow, create a symlink to your application directory, for instance `ln -s $(pwd) ~/.pow/earthdata-search`\r\n(making your app available at `http://earthdata-search.dev`).  If you set up Earthdata Login, ensure that the domain matches\r\nthe callback URL specified in Earthdata Login.\r\n\r\n### Initial setup\r\n\r\nRun\r\n\r\n    bin/setup\r\n\r\nOpen `config/application.yml` and edit configuration values as described in that file to set up Earthdata Login, shapefile support,\r\nand placename completion as appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Running\r\n\r\nIf you set up Pow, simply visit `http://earthdata-search.dev`,\r\notherwise run `rails s` in the project directory and visit `http://localhost:3000`.\r\n",
